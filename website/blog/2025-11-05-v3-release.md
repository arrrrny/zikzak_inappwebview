# ZikZak InAppWebView v3.0 is Here!

We're thrilled to announce the release of **ZikZak InAppWebView v3.0** - a major milestone for this actively maintained fork of the popular flutter_inappwebview plugin.

<!-- truncate -->

## What is ZikZak InAppWebView?

If you're not familiar with the backstory: the original flutter_inappwebview plugin, despite having 3.6k+ stars and being used by thousands of developers worldwide, has been left unmaintained. Critical bugs, iOS 18 crashes, and Xcode 16 build failures have gone unaddressed for months.

**We said: enough is enough.**

ZikZak InAppWebView is a fork that's actively maintained by a human+AI team (ARRRRNY + Claude AI). We're committed to:

- ✅ Responding to issues within 24-48 hours
- ✅ Reviewing and merging PRs promptly
- ✅ Fixing critical bugs
- ✅ Modernizing the codebase
- ✅ Implementing security-first features

## What's New in v3.0?

v3.0 is not just a bug fix release - it's a **major modernization** with intentional breaking changes to make the plugin more secure, maintainable, and performant.

### Completed Changes

#### 1. Platform Focus: Android & iOS Only

We've removed support for macOS, Windows, and Web. Why?

- **Focus is everything**: By focusing solely on mobile platforms, we can deliver better quality and faster updates
- **Lean codebase**: Less code means fewer bugs and easier maintenance
- **Modern mobile APIs**: We can leverage the latest Android and iOS WebView technologies without worrying about desktop compatibility

#### 2. Minimum SDK Requirements Raised

- **Android**: Minimum SDK raised from 19 to 24 (Android 7.0+)
- **iOS**: Minimum version raised from 13.0 to 15.0+

This allows us to:
- Use modern WebView APIs
- Remove legacy workarounds
- Improve security with newer platform features
- Reduce codebase complexity

#### 3. Security-First by Default

**Google Safe Browsing is now enabled by default!**

Your users are protected from phishing, malware, and unwanted software out of the box. No configuration needed!

```dart
InAppWebView(
  initialSettings: InAppWebViewSettings(
    safeBrowsingEnabled: true,  // ← Already enabled by default!
  ),
  onSafeBrowsingHit: (controller, url, threatType) async {
    // Handle detected threats
    return SafeBrowsingResponse(
      action: SafeBrowsingResponseAction.BACK_TO_SAFETY,
      report: true,
    );
  },
)
```

Other security features available:
- **Certificate Pinning**: SHA-256 public key pinning for MITM prevention
- **HTTPS-Only Mode**: Block or upgrade insecure HTTP requests
- **URL Scheme Validation**: Block dangerous schemes
- **Content Security Policy**: Proper HTTP header-based CSP

Check out the full [Security Features documentation](/docs/security-features) for details.

#### 4. Published to pub.dev

You can now install ZikZak InAppWebView directly from pub.dev:

```yaml
dependencies:
  zikzak_inappwebview: ^3.0.0
```

No more git dependencies or version conflicts!

## What's Coming Next?

This is just the beginning. Our [Modernization Plan](/docs/modernization-plan) includes:

### Phase 2: Settings Cleanup
- Remove 30+ redundant settings
- Simplify configuration
- Better defaults

### Phase 3: JavaScript Security
- Disable JavaScript by default (opt-in for security)
- Proper sandboxing
- Secure JavaScript bridge

### Phase 4: Architecture Refactoring
- Break up 2000+ line classes
- Apply SOLID principles
- Improve testability

### Phase 5+: Modern Features
- Android WebMessageListener
- iOS WKContentWorld
- Better cookie management
- Improved testing support

## Migration Guide

### Breaking Changes

If you're migrating from flutter_inappwebview or zikzak_inappwebview v2.x, here's what you need to know:

#### 1. Platform Support

**Before (v2.x):**
```yaml
# Supported: Android, iOS, macOS, Windows, Web
```

**After (v3.0):**
```yaml
# Supported: Android, iOS only
```

If you need macOS/Windows/Web support, stay on v2.x or use the original flutter_inappwebview package.

#### 2. Minimum SDK Requirements

**Android:**
- Update your `android/app/build.gradle`:
```gradle
android {
    defaultConfig {
        minSdk 24  // Changed from 19
    }
}
```

**iOS:**
- Update your `ios/Podfile`:
```ruby
platform :ios, '15.0'  # Changed from 13.0
```

#### 3. Safe Browsing

Safe Browsing is now enabled by default. If you want to disable it (not recommended):

```dart
InAppWebView(
  initialSettings: InAppWebViewSettings(
    safeBrowsingEnabled: false,
  ),
)
```
